This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## Next.js Project - Tutorial Followed from "JS Dev Hindi"

This is a README file for a Next.js project created by following the tutorial videos of "JS Dev Hindi". In this tutorial, you'll learn various concepts and techniques for building a Next.js application. The project covers the following topics:
Project Overview

The project focuses on building a Next.js application with a server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) approach. It includes dynamic routing, rapid UI building using Tailwind CSS, a mobile-first responsive approach, functional programming with utility methods, integration with Strapi Headless CMS, data fetching from Strapi API, Redux fundamentals, and implementing cart functionality. The tutorial also covers project deployment for both the frontend and backend.
Technologies Used

### The project incorporates the following technologies and frameworks:

    Next.js 13 and its latest features
    Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) in Next.js
    Dynamic Routing in Next.js
    Tailwind CSS for rapid UI building
    Mobile-first responsive approach for design
    Functional programming through utility methods
    Strapi Headless CMS and its features
    Fetching data from Strapi APIs in the Next.js application
    Redux fundamentals for state management
    Cart functionality implementation with add, update, and delete actions
    
    

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
